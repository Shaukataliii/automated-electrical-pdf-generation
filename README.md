# Automated Pull Sheet PDF Population

---

## Overview

Manual completion of electrical pull sheet PDFs is a repetitive, time-consuming process prone to human error. This challenge affects electrical engineers, contractors, and project managers who routinely prepare documentation for panel wiring and instrumentation.

**Automated Pull Sheet PDF Population** is a tailored automation solution that transforms raw Excel data into fully populated, ready-to-use PDF check sheets — significantly reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

## Who Benefits

* **Electrical engineers** saving hours otherwise spent on tedious data entry
* **Contractors** ensuring accurate and consistent documentation
* **Project managers** improving workflow efficiency and traceability

---

## The Problem

* Manual PDF form filling from large Excel datasets is slow and error-prone
* Mistakes in data transcription lead to costly rework and delays
* Managing multiple file versions and naming conflicts adds complexity

---

## The Solution

This project automates the entire process with a Python-based workflow that:

* Reads and processes Excel pull sheet data, including date formatting
* Dynamically selects the correct PDF template (digital or analog) based on input type
* Automatically populates and saves individualized PDFs with unique filenames
* Provides detailed logging for easy monitoring and troubleshooting

---

## Key Benefits

* **Time saved:** Automates hundreds of manual entries into accurate, formatted PDFs
* **Error reduction:** Eliminates transcription mistakes and enforces consistent data formatting
* **Effort minimized:** Frees up staff to focus on higher-value tasks
* **Improved traceability:** Logging offers clear audit trails for process validation

---

## Technology Highlights

* Python scripting with **pandas** for robust data handling
* **fillpdfs** library for seamless PDF form population
* Comprehensive logging to track progress and errors
* Compatible with standard Excel (.xlsx) input and PDF form templates

---

## About the Development

The automation workflow was carefully designed and implemented to ensure reliability and maintainability, covering all stages from data input to final PDF output. The solution can be adapted or extended for other similar documentation automation needs.

---

## Collaboration and Next Steps

I welcome collaboration opportunities to:

* Expand automation to other check sheet types
* Integrate with project management and documentation systems
* Develop user-friendly interfaces for broader adoption

---

## Why It Matters

By streamlining a critical yet mundane task in electrical project documentation, this automation delivers tangible productivity gains, higher accuracy, and consistent quality—ultimately contributing to smoother project execution and reduced operational risk.
